# Challenge
## Important notes
I had to switch the API in order for the app to work, because this app is 6 months old and the other API was deprecated, so some things may seem strange, such as the rating being hardcoded to 3(it was a value received from the API) and the date is not formatted(i was receiving already formatted) and the API key is hardcoded in the project(which is really bad), but I couldn't update all those things because I had little time in my friends MacBook to update to TMDB API and switch the language from Portuguese to English. All because I am not able to access any repository that is not from my company with their MacBook.
